algorithmacs
============

Algorithmic style for Texmacs such that one can enter algorithms of CLRS psudocode style.

In particular, all blocks are represented python-style, i.e., identation is what indicate the end of the block.

I have built this on the top of a code snippet, I found in a mailing list but I don't remember the original author's name. So, thank you whoever you are.
